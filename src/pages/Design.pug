  h2 Introduction

  p Driven by the wish to develop a solution for one of the leading local concerns – the excessive copper contamination in the soils of local vineyards – we squeezed our brains to bring out the maximum of our creativity and engineering intuition. Therefore, the goal was to understand how to approach this problem in a way that would get the most out of our whole design.
  p Thus, the first step was to choose the chassis that would welcome our solution. This process took several back and forths, round tables and exchanges. After a lot of bibliographic research in the fields of bioaccumulation and bioremediation, consultations and comparisons with both experts in synthetic biology and local producers, we narrowed down our selection until finally choosing yeast as the chassis. At this point, the main interest became which solution to develop in order to optimize our results. Different solutions have already been developed, created and tested to target the problem of heavy metal removal, many of which have been developed on yeast strains. Moreover, different metallothionein proteins have been studied and classified mainly by size, binding affinity, number of attracted copper ions, expression, folding, and biological activity. With this in mind, the next step for us was finding the suitable protein to help us solve our targeted problem and capture as much copper as possible, saving our project and our soils.

  h3 CUP1

  p Several factors were considered before choosing the perfect protein for our project. The initial goal was to assemble a complex able to accumulate copper both inside and outside the cell. This complex would include three main components: an intracellular protein for cytoplasmic storage of copper ions, a transmembrane protein allowing the traffic of the ions from the external environment, and a metallothionein expressed on the extracellular surface to bind ions. Fortunately, we realized that the first two components of this complex are already endogenous functions of the wildtype yeast: that is, being able to transport copper ions in the intracellular space and store them there. Nevertheless, why don't we also try to express the same intracellular protein able to bind copper on the surface?
  p During this process, many other metal-binding proteins were considered, but none of them compared with the original intracellular protein in terms of the ability to attract eight copper ions simultaneously, stability, and protein characterization. [rx] The protein here chosen, responsible for copper tolerance, is called CUP1, a polypeptide of 61 amino acids – with its leading eight residues post-translationally cleaved off – resulting in a 53-residue final processed polypeptide. This protein sequence is particularly interesting: it contains 12 cysteine residues organized as Cys--X--Cys, Cys--Cys, and Cys--X--X--Cys, which produce four different binding sites for divalent metal ions and eight for monovalent ions, with high affinity for copper and cadmium. [rx] In sum, CUP1 can bind eight copper ions through 12 cysteines per molecule.
  p The CUP1 processed primary structure is a yeast metallothionein 53-residue polypeptide of molecular weight 5,655 Da. Reconstitution studies of the apo-molecule revealed that 8 mol eq of Cu(I) conferred maximal stability against proteolysis and depleted the zinc content of zinc-saturated metallothionein. These assays, therefore, suggested that, as mentioned above, the protein has eight binding sites for Cu(I). However, Ag(I) ions are bound to the protein with the same stoichiometry. Additionally, this yeast metallothionein was observed to coordinate two additional ions in vitro: Cd(II) and Zn(II). In particular, in studies of direct binding, protection against proteolysis, and metal ion exchange, these divalent ions were found to associate with the protein with a maximal stoichiometry of 4 ions per molecule. Yeast metallothionein thus exhibits, as does the mammalian protein, two distinct binding configurations for Cu(I) and Cd(II). [rx]
  p A gene replacement experiment has shown that the CUP1 protein has two functions in yeast. First, it protects cells against the toxic effects of high concentrations of copper added to the medium. Second, it acts to repress the transcription of its own structural gene at low external copper concentrations. Indeed, transcription of the CUP1 gene is rapidly induced by copper. However, studies showed that unlike the mammalian metallothionein genes, transcription of the yeast gene is not affected by other ions such as cadmium, zinc, or mercury (karin, Butt).

  h3 Expression system

  p Yeast surface display is a powerful method for producing engineered proteins to increase their affinity, specificity and stability. In addition, an antibody to fluorescein has been engineered to femtomolar affinity, the highest affinity reported so far. Yeast display has also been used to engineer other proteins with a variety of applications. [rx] Yeast surface display offers several advantages for protein-directed evolution. First, it enables quantitative screening through fluorescence-activated cell sorting, allowing the equilibrium activity and statistics of the sample to be observed directly during the screening process. Furthermore, the protein-binding signal is normalized for expression, eliminating artefacts due to host expression bias and allowing for acceptable discrimination between mutants.
  p Antibodies can be engineered for improved stability, as the expression is measured directly and has been shown to correlate with the stability of the displayed protein.
  p Once maturation is complete, antibody affinity can be conveniently ‘titrated’ while displayed on the surface of the yeast, obviating the need for expression and purification of each clone. Finally, the displayed proteins are folded in the endoplasmic reticulum of the eukaryotic yeast cells, taking advantage of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones and quality-control ‘machinery’.

  p For engineering a single protein sequence, the DNA of interest must first be cloned into a yeast surface display vector and then (try to discuss the protocol shortly).
  p [The mutagenized yeast library is created by transformation of yeast with linearized vector and the error-prone PCR product, and in vivo homologous recombination occurs between the vector and PCR insert to generate the display plasmid.]

  p In order to express CUP1 on the surface, we decided to use a surface display strategy. In the yeast surface display system, CUP1 is displayed in a single-chain variable fragment format, and it is fused to the adhesion subunit of the yeast agglutinin protein Aga2p, which is attached to the yeast cell wall and Aga1p through disulfide bonds. Expression of the Aga2p--CUP1 is under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter on the yeast display plasmid - maintained in yeast episomally with a nutritional marker – whereas Aga1p is expressed from a chromosomally integrated galactose-inducible expression cassette. Moreover, variations in surface expression can be measured through immuno-fluorescence labelling of the V5 epitope tag flanking CUP1.

  h2 Dimers

  p To improve the ability of our original construct, we chose to join together two units of CUP1 through different linking sequences. This intuition should allow for a significant improvement in the copper absorption capabilities of our chassis, effectively doubling the presence of CUP1 on the surface and ideally leading to a twofold improvement in copper uptake and resistance.
  p In order to develop such a complex, we decided to use two slightly different CUP1 sequences to avoid any problem of homology – the two coupled by a linker. [Details of the two slightly different CUP1] Different linkers have been modelled and tested in order to obtain the most stable and efficient structure. Once the modelling process was finished, all the created complexes – 7 – were cloned and tested, observing excellent results on each of them, thus showing a clear improvement over the original complex.

  h3 Linkers

  p The successful design of a fusion protein requires two indispensable elements: the component proteins and the linkers. The choice of the whole complex is based on the desired functions of the fusion protein product and, in most cases, is relatively straightforward. On the other hand, the selection or rational design of a suitable linker to join the protein domains together can be arduous and is often the most critical step in designing fusion proteins. The direct fusion of functional domains without a linker may lead to several undesirable outcomes, including misfolding of the fusion proteins, low yield in protein production, or impaired bioactivity. Moreover, these linker peptides not only serve to connect the protein moieties, but also provide several other functions, such as maintaining cooperative inter-domain interactions, leading to the proper folding of the whole complex, preserving biological activity of the two single proteins, and sometimes adding new active functions.
  p Indeed, by genetically fusing two or more protein domains, the fusion protein product may obtain many distinct functions derived from each of their component moieties.
  p Generally, preferable amino acids were polar uncharged or charged residues, constituting approximately 50% of naturally encoded amino acids. Several studies suggested that Pro, Thr, and Gln were the preferable amino acids for natural linkers. Among them, Pro is a unique amino acid with a cyclic side chain that leads to a very restricted conformation. The lack of amide hydrogen on Pro may prevent the formation of hydrogen bonds with other amino acids, and therefore reduces the interaction between the linkers and the protein domains. As a result, the inclusion of Pro residues might increase the stiffness and structural independence of the linkers.
  p The α-helix is a rigid and stable structure, with intra-segment hydrogen bonds and a closely packed backbone. Furthermore, some α-helical conformations form rapidly during folding, allowing the correct folding of connecting protein domains without non-native interactions with the linker and maintaining the proper distance between the two moieties. Therefore, linkers in an α-helix structure might also serve as rigid spacers to effectively separate protein domains, and to reduce their unfavourable interactions.

    li Increase stability and folding
    li Increase expression
    li Increase biological activity

  p In order to fuse two different CUP1 and develop the best models for the dimers, we decided to design and test 7 different linkers, each of which eventually led to excellent results.
  p We chose specific designs for each of these linkers to express different features in all dimers. To do so, we mainly played with four factors: length, hydrophobicity, amino acid residues, and secondary structure. The last three could also be categorized under the macro concept of flexibility. Therefore, length and flexibility were the main actors of our design.
  p The length determines the distance between the two proteins, thus allowing greater or lesser interaction between the two. In order to obtain a compromise between the absence of interaction and the size of the complex, we chose sequences that varied between 14 and 20 amino acids, already considered large length according to Georges and Harringay.
  p Flexibility (or rigidity) is instead a parameter used to empirically describe the ability of a protein sequence to maintain a specific conformation (Arai et al. 2001; Argos 1990; George and Heringa 2002). Clearly, this parameter is directly related to the amino acids and thus to the structure of the linker, which would also affect the orientations of the fused proteins. Thus, although the orientation is determined by the structure of the linker, which is difficult to quantify, flexibility is used here to serve as an index of the linker structure. Moreover, previous studies have shown that the flexibility of a linker is associated with the function of fusion proteins, indicating the importance of linker flexibility in the construction of fused proteins.
  p In order to observe the behaviour of our complex in different conformations, we decided to test flexible, semi-rigid and rigid structures.
  p Flexible linkers are usually applied when the joined domains require a certain degree of movement or interaction. As suggested by Argos, they are generally composed of small, non-polar (e.g. Gly) or polar (e.g. Ser or Thr) amino acids. The small size of these amino acids provides flexibility and more degree of freedom allowing for high mobility of the connecting functional domains.
  p The incorporation of Serine or Threonine can maintain the stability of the linker in aqueous solutions by forming hydrogen bonds with the water molecules, and therefore reduces the unfavourable interaction between the linker and the protein moieties.
  p The most commonly used flexible linkers have sequences consisting primarily of stretches of Glycine and Serine residues (“GS” linker). An example of the most widely used flexible linker has the sequence of (Gly--Gly--Gly--Gly--Ser)<sub>n</sub>. By adjusting the copy number “n”, the length of this GS linker can be optimized to achieve appropriate separation of the functional domains, maintain necessary inter-domain interactions, and allow for proper folding of the fusion proteins.
  p In addition, although flexible linkers do not have rigid structures, they can serve as passive linkers to keep a general distance between functional domains.
  p Therefore, regarding the flexible linker, the final choice has been oriented towards a combination of Glycine and Serine, in two different combinations of GGGGS, (GGGGS)<sub>n</sub>, with n = 3, 4.
  p While flexible linkers have the advantage of connecting the functional domains passively and permitting a certain degree of movement, the lack of rigidity of these linkers can be limiting. There are several examples in the literature where flexible linkers resulted in poor expression yields or loss of biological activity. (rx) The ineffectiveness of flexible linkers in these instances was attributed to the inefficient separation of the protein domains or insufficient reduction of their interference with each other. In these situations, rigid linkers have been successfully applied to keep a fixed distance between the domains and maintain their independent functions, separating the functional domains more efficiently than the flexible linkers.
  p Rigid linkers exhibit relatively stiff structures by adopting α-helical structures or by containing multiple Pro residues. Indeed, Pro is a unique amino acid with a cyclic side chain that causes a very restricted conformation. Furthermore, the lack of amide hydrogen on Pro typically prevents the formation of hydrogen bonds with other amino acids, and therefore reduces the interaction between the linkers and the protein domains. As a result, the inclusion of Pro residues might increase the stiffness and structural independence of the linkers.
  p Furthermore, in this case, the length of the linkers can be easily adjusted by changing the copy number to achieve an optimal distance between domains. As a result, rigid linkers are chosen when the spatial separation of the domains is critical to preserve the stability or bioactivity of the fusion proteins.
  p In this case, the most common rigid linker is the alpha helix-forming linkers with the sequence of (EAAAK)<sub>n</sub>, which shows an approximately 80% helicity with n = 3 . As suggested by George and Heringa, many natural linkers exhibited α-helical structures. Indeed, this latter is characterized by high rigidity and stability, with intra-segment hydrogen bonds and a closely packed backbone. Therefore, the stiff α-helical linkers may act as simple rigid spacers between protein domains.
  p Another type of rigid linkers, as explained above, has a Pro-rich sequence, (XP)<sub>n</sub>, with X designating any amino acid, preferably Ala, Lys, or Glu. Therefore, the presence of Pro in non-helical linkers can increase the stiffness, and allows for effective separation of the protein domains as well.
  p Therefore, regarding the rigid linkers, we decided to use either a combination of EAAAK, interested in the resulting α-helix structure, or a combination of AP interested in the properties of the poly-proline sequence.
  p Finally, recombining the entire building units with these significantly different flexibilities can potentially extend the linker mobility range for fusion protein design. Such an approach to generating linkers would benefit from using stable conformational sequences as the entire building units, thereby eliminating unwanted complexity in predicting conformations for various sequences and perturbations between the linker region and connected domains. In addition, as linker flexibility is dependent mainly on its conformation, which is in turn determined by the primary sequence, the linker library by recombining the rigid and flexible building units with a determined total length, can be expected to have widely controllable flexibility, capable of changing from rigidity to flexibility.
  p Therefore for the semi-flexible (or semi-rigid) conformation, we decided to combine the design choices used for flexible and rigid linkers. In particular, the main idea is to separate the two functional domains at a sufficient distance to prevent any interaction between the two and maintain their independent functions while allowing extreme flexibility in the area close to the C and N terminus of the fusion proteins. In this way, the complex will be highly rigid in the centre and particularly flexible in the vicinity of the two proteins allowing further degrees of freedom, proper folding, thus further facilitating the process of copper uptake. Accordingly, the structures used for the semi-rigid linker are:
  p GGGGS(EAAAK)<sub>n</sub>GGGS, with n = 1, 2, alpha helicity of around 15-20% and 25-30% respectively,
  p In summary, linkers can adopt various structures and exert diverse functions to fulfil the application of fusion proteins. The flexible linkers are often rich in small or hydrophilic amino acids such as Gly or Ser to provide structural flexibility and have been applied to connect functional domains that favour interdomain interactions or movements. In cases where sufficient separation of protein domains is required, rigid linkers may be preferable. By adopting α-helical structures or incorporating Pro, the rigid linkers can efficiently keep protein moieties at a distance. Both flexible and rigid linkers are stable in vivo and do not allow joined proteins to separate.
