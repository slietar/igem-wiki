  h2(id="protocol-beads") Alginate beads production<span class="ref-group"><ref id="tu-eindhoven" authors="iGEM TU Eindhoven" title="Alginate beads" url="http://2015.igem.org/wiki/images/4/4c/TU_Eindhoven_Protocols_Alginate_beads.pdf" year="2015" />, <ref authors="AMSBIO" title="Alginate 3D Cell Culture Kit" url="https://resources.amsbio.com/Datasheets/AMS.CSR-ABC-KIT.pdf" /></span>

  p The protocol below is solely for making beads that contain cells which are to be used capturing devices: it does not respect sterility rules.


  h3 Sodium-alginate cell solution preparation

  p Estimated bench time: 5 minutes. Estimated total time: 55 minutes.
  p Purpose: This 2% solution is the basis for the yeast beads.

  h4 Materials
  ul
    li: p 2 g alginic acid sodium salt powder (sodium alginate)
    li: p 100 ml of cell dense media (OD600 of 4)
    li: p a stirring plate and magnet

  h4 Setup and protocol
  ol
    li: p Mix alginic acid sodium salt powder into 100 ml cell dense media.
    li: p Stir for 50 minutes at 700 rpm at 30°C.
    li: p Make sure the magnet stays at the bottom of the liquid solution. If not, slow down the rotation until the magnet sinks and slowly resume 700 rpm rotation.

  h4 Alternative steps for testing (additional 20-40 minutes)
  ol
    li: p Since sterility must be guaranteed when testing, first make the sodium alginate solution with 2 g in 67 ml of the media in which your cells grow.
    li: p Autoclave at 120°C for 20 minutes.
    li: p Mix in 33 ml of yeast solution at OD600 of 12. This step might require concentrating the yeast by centrifugation and removal of a part of the supernatant.


  h3 Calcium chloride solution preparation

  p Estimated bench time: 5 minutes. Estimated total time: 5 minutes.
  p Purpose: This 100 mM solution crosslinks the alginate to form a gel like structure.

  h4 Materials
  ul
    li 150 ml of distilled sterile water
    li 1.6647 g of CaCl2

  h4 Setup and protocol
  ol
    li: p Mix CaCl2 in distilled sterile water.
    li: p Stir by shaking gently.

  h4 Additional steps for testing
  ol
    li: p Autoclave for 20 minutes at 120°C.


  h3 Bead formation

  p Estimated bench time: 15 minutes. Estimated total time: 15 minutes.
  p Purpose: Form regularly sized beads that contain yeast.

  h4 Materials
  ul
    li 100 ml alginate-sodium-cell solution
    li 250 ml bottle filled with 150 ml of 100 mM CaCl solution
    li a stirring magnet and a stir plate
    li a 10 ml syringe (or equivalent)

  h4 Setup and protocol (estimated 30 minutes)
  ol
    li: p Fill the syringe with alginate solution.
    li: p Open the CaCl2 bottle and drop the sterilized magnet inside.
    li: p Stir the CaCl2 solution at 400 rpm during the whole experiment.
    li: p Drop drops of alginate into the bottle while stirring.
    li: p Continue stirring until 5 minutes have passed since the last bead was made.

  p Tip: If the alginate is dropped from high enough, interfacial forces between the alginate and the air around it will have enough time to separate a faster stream of liquid into evenly sized spherical beads. This makes the process much quicker.


  h3 Bead conservation

  h4 Materials
  ul
    li 100 ml of media (if cell growth is not desired)
    li 100 ml of deionized water (otherwise)

  h4 Setup and protocol
  ol
    li: p Discard CaCl2.
    li: p Pour the media or water into the bead bottle and keep at 4°C.


  h3 Bead dissolution<ref doi="10.1080/09593330.2019.1673827" />

  h4 Materials
  ul
    li Na-citrate 0.5 M

  h4 Protocol
  ol
    li: p Mix about 10 beads in per 5 ml of 5 0.5 M Na-citrate.
    li: p Wait for an approximate 20 minutes for bead dissolution.

    li: p Heat shock at exactly 42°C for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix.
    li: p Place on ice for 2 minutes. Do not mix.
    li: p Pipette 950 µl of room temperature SOC into the mixture. Immediately spread 50-100 µl onto a selection plate and incubate overnight at 37-42°C. Note: Selection using antibiotics other than ampicillin may require some outgrowth before plating on selective media. Colonies develop faster at temperatures above 37°C, however some constructs may be unstable at elevated temperatures.

  h3 Yeast preparation

  p Purpose: This protocol is a guide for preparing yeasts cultures for copper absorption and removal monitoring.

  h4 Materials
  ul
    li appropriate medium (YPD, SGCAA or SDCAA)
    li CuSO4 powder
    li 250 ml erlenmeyer
    li spectrophotometer (OD600 measures for yeast population density)
    li centrifuge

  h4 Setup and protocol
  ol
    li: p Prepare fresh yeast culture in appropriate medium and concentrate it by centrifugation (2000g, 10 minutes, RT) to a density corresponding to an OD600 that is 2X the final OD600.
    li: p Prepare fresh media supplemented with copper by dissolving CuSO4 powder at a final concentration of 8 mg/l (2X final concentration).
    li: p Prepare a separate copper-supplemented medium sample (without yeast) by diluting the 2X copper solution to 1X and keep it as an initial copper concentration control (t<sub>-1</sub>).
    li: p Start the experiment by mixing half of the yeast culture with half of the copper-supplemented medium in a 250 ml erlenmeyer.
    li: p Swirl to assure homogeneity and directly collect 3 times 2 ml of the mix as the first time point (t<sub>0</sub>).
    li: p Put the erlenmeyers to shaking (220 rpm) at 37°C.
    li: p Repeat the collection step at the following time points: t<sub>1</sub> = 15 min, t<sub>2</sub> = 30 min, t<sub>3</sub> = 60 min, t<sub>4</sub> = 90 min and t<sub>5</sub> = 120 min.
    li: p Keep collected samples at 4°C until measurement.
    li: p Keep the copper-loaded yeasts at 4°C for subsequent copper unloading measurements.


  h3 Cuprizone preparation

  p Purpose: This solution is used for chelating copper, and hence detecting it with a 600 nm absorbance measurement<ref doi="10.1039/b701896g" />. Up to 95 tests can be used from the 250 ml produced.

  h4 Materials
  ul
    li 1 250 ml bottle
    li 1.25 g cuprizone 99%
    li 125 ml deionized water
    li 125 ml ethanol 99%

  h4 Setup and protocol
  ol
    li: p Add cuprizone, water and ethanol into the bottle.
    li: p Stir with a magnetic stirrer at 70°C for for 20 minutes or until cuprizone is dissolved.
    li: p Let the bottle cool to about 35°C before use.

  p Tip: The cuprizone solution won't be at the temperature indicated on the stirring plate's screen before a while. Keep the temperature at 200°C during the first 8 minutes for quickly bringing the temperature of the solution to its desired value.

    li: p Put 450 µl of each sample into its corresponding cuvette.
    li: p Add 3 drops of NaOH 0.2 M.
    li: p Set up a timer.
    li: p Every 40 seconds, pipette 2.55 ml of cuprizone per cuvette into 3 empty cuvettes until all cuvettes are full. Keep track of the cuvettes as you will have to follow the same order when measuring.
    li: p At the 16 minutes time point, measure the first samples. Proceed by measuring 3 samples at a time every 40 seconds.



  //- h3 k<sub>f</sub> measurement

  //- p Estimated bench time: 30 minutes. Estimated total time: 30 minutes.
  //- p Purpose: This measurement is needed for calculating the relationship between copper concentration and absorbance. This part can be done simultaneously with the samples, as concentration is not needed for measurements of absorbance.

  //-   li: p The multiplicative factor is equal to the concentration/absorbance ratio.


  h3 Building a calibration curve

  p Purpose: This measurement is needed for calculating the relationship between copper concentration and absorbance. This part can be done simultaneously with the samples.
  p Warning: Make sure that you use the same blank for the calibration and for the samples and that you use the same media as for the samples.

  p The calibration curves are made using exactly the same protocol as for the rest of the samples.

  //-   li: p At the 16 minutes time point (if the original samples are expected to have lower copper concentration than 5 mg) or at the 20 minutes time point (if the original samples are expected to have higher copper concentration than 5 mg/l), measure the first samples. Proceed by measuring 3 samples at a time every 40 seconds. <em>Warning: 30 seconds is a short time, this is difficult to achieve alone.</em>


  //- h3 General comments

  //- ul
  //-   li: p As the copper measurements are very long to conduct individually, it is recommended to conduct at least 4 tests at a time. When a great number of tests must be conducted use the “Large Experiment” protocol.
  //-   li: p For samples in a same series, do not switch between 16 or 20 minutes wait time, as the results will be incorrect. The reason for indicating different timings is because cuprizon stabilizes around those times. The error due to reaction kinetics and timing are smaller if the reaction time is chosen correctly. For higher concentrations, times for stabilization can be more than 25 minutes. However, around 25 minutes, the amount of cuprizone unbinding from the copper is significant and thus adds variability to the results.
