      .date 2021-07-12

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Extract and amplify our genomic CUP1 sequence from yeast DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-gene-pcr">Gene PCR</a>
    p We had 3 genomic variants that we named Y1, Y2 and Y3. The samples were normalized to similar concentrations and the PCR was run with 20ng of DNA material.
    p We ran a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis to check our PCR product size. We prepared two sets of tubes, one destined to the gel electrophoresis and one to be cleaned up as we do not have a UV “table” in our lab.

      .date 2021-07-13

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Linearization of the pCT-con2-V5 plasmid by restriction enzyme digestion for subsequent Gibson assembly.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-plasmid-digestion">Plasmid digestion</a>
    p <strong>Results</strong> To verify our digestion worked properly, we ran a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis of our plasmid digested with different combinations of our restriction enzymes: BamHI alone, NheI alone, BamHI and NheI together or no enzymes.

        span Lane 1: GeneRuler 1 kb DNA Ladder. Lane 2: Plasmid digested with BamHI HF. Lane 3: Plasmid digested with NheI HF. Lane 4: Plasmid digested with both BamHI HF and NheI HF. Lane 5: Undigested plasmid. The bands in lane 2, 3 and 4 are slightly bigger than 6000 bp while the band in lane 5 is above the 10,000 band of the ladder. pCTcon2-V5 is 6468 bp.

    p The size of our plasmid, pCTcon2-V5<ref doi="10.1038/nprot.2006.94" />, is 6468 bp. We should observe bands of this size when cutting the plasmid with either BamHI or NheI.
    p Linear DNA encounters less friction while running through the gel than circular DNA. Thus, on our gel, we expect to see the plasmid cut with either BamHI or NheI run faster than the undigested plasmid, as the plasmid would have been linearized.
    p The size of the insert between BamHI and NheI is 189 bp while the size of the plasmid without the insert is 6279 bp. In lane 4 where our plasmid was cut with both restriction enzymes, we thus expect a band near 6000 bp. Since the size difference is so small with the plasmid that was cut with only one restriction enzyme, we do not expect a difference on the gel. Furthermore, the insert band of 189 bp is too small to be seen on this gel thus we do not expect to see it.

    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> We were able to digest the pCTcon2V5 plasmid with BamHI and NheI and it worked properly. Thus we could continue with the next experiment.

    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> Our transformed bacteria had successfully taken up the plasmid containing the ampicillin resistance gene. Moreover, as we had asserted that the digestion was successful and as we know that bacteria can only function properly with circular DNA we could conclude that our Gibson assembly was successful.

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Compare our now amplified plasmid with the theoretical sequence to observe potential mutations that may have occurred during amplification in bacteria.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> Send samples to a DNA sequencing company (Mycrosynth in our case).
    p We sent 2 clones for each transformant variant: YXCX where X stands for the number of the variant and clone respectively.
    p <strong>Results</strong> The alignment of the sequencing results are on <a href="assets/notebook/monomer/13.pdf">this document</a>, where the sequences number 1 to 12 correspond to, respectively Y1C1 forward, Y1C1 reverse and so on until Y3C2 reverse.
    p Y2C1 has a mutation (G to C) in both forward and reverse strands. We thus choose to ignore this one. It also seems like the forward primer of Y2C2 did not anneal, therefore we do not have a full strand. To avoid errors, we decide to only keep Y1 and Y3 variants.
    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> We decided to proceed with only Y1 and Y3 genomic variants and had two clones for each of them.

    p We made 3 technical replicates and 2 biological replicates, but limited by the space on the shaker we could only do one.

    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-yeast-transformation">Yeast transformation</a>
    p We prepared 3 samples: a negative control (no plasmid), a positive control (our plasmid backbone without the CUP1 insert) and the plasmid containing the CUP1 gene.
    p Our yeast strain, EBY100, is incapable of synthesizing tryptophan on its own and needs it from an external source, thus when plated onto tryptophan-less medium plates, they cannot grow. Our plasmid backbone encodes a Trp+ gene allowing the yeast to grow without tryptophan in its medium, allowing for positive selection of our yeast transformants.
    p We picked clones from each plate and amplified them in liquid SDCAA medium. In total we picked 6 clones from the yeast transformed with the recombinant plasmid : A, B, C, D, E and F.

    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-western-blot">Western blot</a>
    p We used two mouse anti-V5 and anti-Tubulin as primary antibodies and a goat anti-mouse as a secondary.
    p The first Western blot was performed on clone A and B and had for negative controls, the wild type yeast as well as the yeast transformed with the plasmid backbone cultured in SDCAA (without galactose). For positive controls, the yeast transformed with the plasmid backbone cultured in SGCAA (with galactose) as well as a fly tubulin were runned onto the gel.

        span Aga2-V5 has a molecular weight of 21.3 kDa.

    p We loaded the following samples onto our gel: pCTcon2-V5 in SDCAA, pCTcon2-V5 in SGCAA, EBY100 (WT) in YPD, and two pCTcon2-CUP1-V5 clones (A and B) in SGCAA and SDCAA each. We obtained a band of ~ 50 kDa in the WT and plasmids with and without galactose, showing the presence of ⍺-tubulin (49.8 kDa<ref title="Tubulin alpha-1 chain (P09733)" authors="UniProt" url="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P09733" />) in our samples. We also have a band of ~ 20 kDa in plasmid + galactose showing that our Aga2-V5 protein was expressed (figure 7a). Figure 7b is showing the fly control expressing tubulin as well as Relish-V5, a protein harboring the V5 tag. Figure 7c shows the ratio of V5 signal versus tubulin.
    p However we didn’t obtain any signal, neither for the tubulin nor the protein of interest in the clone A and B lines (figure 6).

    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> The clones were probably picked prematurely, and thus didn’t show anything on the gel. That’s why a second Western Blot was performed in order to check protein expression in our 4 other clones that were picked later: C, D, E and F.

    p All 4 clones showed expression of CUP1 on their surface. We assumed the expression is at the surface because : first, the antibody does not enter the cell, second, we can see a darker circle around the cell on figure 8j (higher magnification) representing the membrane and third, we did some controls with membrane permeabilized samples (figure 8g). The membrane permalized samples show little signal that corresponds to the signal in negative controls WT (figure 8f), backbone without antibody 1 (figure 8h) and backbone without antibody 2 (figure 8i), which we can assume is noise or unspecific binding of antibodies.
    p Unfortunately, not all cells were positive in one sample, which means that either our subsets of cells were not monoclonal and that not all the cells had the plasmid or that they all had the plasmid but weren't all expressing it.
    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> In order to see if the expression level differences were due to polyclonality of the yeast population we streaked the cells on a plate and picked a single colony in order to perform an immunostaining on a monoclonal population of cells. This resulted in no different results than before, we still had an heterogeneous population with cells displaying signal and cells with no signal. We concluded that the induction process was not 100% efficient and this was supported by the results of the paper from Chao et al.<ref doi="10.1038/nprot.2006.94" />

    p We obtained bands of approximatively 25 kDa in positive control as well as in clones C, E and F, showing that our protein of interest was present in these samples. Unfortunately we didn’t have any signal for the ⍺-tubulin so we couldn’t normalize the signal and compare the expression level of the protein. As expected, in the negative control pCTcon2-V5 backbone plasmid uninduced, no band is visible.
    p We also noticed two bands on the gel, and verified the DNA sequence and saw that a second methionine, a start codon, is present downstream of the first one and in frame with the promoter, resulting in a second expressed protein, probably truncated. Unfortunately this shorter protein is the most expressed one, corresponding to the signal intensity.

    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> We’ve decided to continue the experiments with our 3 clones C, E and F, since D didn’t show any expression.

On the left is represented the signal of V5 tag and on the right, the tubulin signal. (c) is the normalized V5 signal for tubulin (V5 in % of tubulin).

    p We obtained a tubulin signal in both plasmid backbone pCTcon2-V5 and clone F (pCTcon2-CUP1-V5) but not in wild type yeast. This was probably due to the fact that a smaller quantity of cells were loaded on the gel, since the pellet was smaller in the WT sample. We could normalize the V5 signal relatively to tubulin and the result is shown on figure 10c. We can see that clone F expresses the protein a bit more than the backbone, which is consistent with what we observed in immunostaining.

    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> We were able to show that our membrane protein fusion was expressed in our engineered yeast and could quantify its relative expression in our clone F as well as in the positive control, the backbone plasmid transformed yeast.

Lane 5: Undigested plasmid. The bands in lane 2, 3 and 4 have an approximate size of 6000 bp while the band in lane 5 is around the 8,000-10,000 bands of the ladder.

    p The size of our plasmid, pCTcon2-V5<ref doi="10.1038/nprot.2006.94" />, is 6468 bp. We should observe bands of this size when cutting the plasmid with either BamHI or NheI.
    p Linear DNA encounters less friction while running through the gel than circular DNA. Thus, on our gel, we expect to see the plasmid cut with either BamHI or NheI run faster than the undigested plasmid, as the plasmid would have been linearized.
    p The size of the insert between BamHI and NheI is 189 bp while the size of the plasmid without the insert is 6279 bp. In lane 4 where our plasmid was cut with both restriction enzymes, we thus expect a band near 6000 bp. Since the size difference is so small with the plasmid that was cut with only one restriction enzyme, we do not expect a difference on the gel. Furthermore, the insert band of 189 bp is too small to be seen on this gel thus we do not expect to see it.

    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> pCTcon2V5 plasmid was successfully linearized by BamHI and NheI digestion.

    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-gene-pcr">Gene PCR</a>
    p These dimer sequences are made of two copies of CUP1 fused by a linker that we designed (see <a href="Design.html">the Design page</a> for information). We ordered the sequences from Twist and went through a PCR to amplify and add the overlap sequences we needed for the Gibson assembly. We have 7 different dimer sequences, each discriminated by a unique linker. The samples were normalized to similar concentrations and the PCR was run with 20 ng of DNA material.

    p According to the Yeast Growth Curve previously made during the version 1 (CUP1 monomer) experiments, we let yeast grow in YPD for approximately 10 hours in order for them to reach an appropriate OD600 = 8 concentration.

After transformation, we plated our transformants on plates that do not contain tryptophan (SGCAA agar plates), for positive selection as the plasmid encodes a Trp+ gene, this allows the transformed yeast to survive on such a medium.

    p <strong>Results</strong> The negative control (water) did not show any colonies and the positive control (plasmid backbone) had many colonies. We could also observe colonies on our transformants plates.

All our yeast clones are expressing their corresponding CUP1 dimer at their surface, although in one sample not all the cells express it. This is due to the fact that the expression yield is not 100%. We can see that some dimers are better than others, for example dimers 6 and 7 have good expression efficiency while dimer 1 have lower expression yield. We also don’t have the same amount of cells in each sample, due to experiment manipulations and not reliable OD measurements. Fortunately we can see that our protein of interest is expressed at the surface of the cell because of the darker green circle representing the cell membrane. This can be better seen on a higher magnification image.

      h3 Copper absorption assay

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Measure the yeast ability to remove copper in solution for the different strains.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> We grew our various engineered yeast strains in liquid media containing copper and we collected 2 ml aliquots of the culture at different time points after addition of yeasts in the media (T0, 15 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min). The yeast cultures were prepared in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, and incubated at 30°C under 200 rpm shaking. Each of the collected samples were then slowly centrifuged (200g for 10 minutes) to separate the yeast cell from the media and copper sulphate solution. Note that the centrifugation step was performed at a low speed to avoid any cell lysis, hence preventing the presence of yeast components, free or bound to copper ions, in the supernatant. This is done mainly for two reasons. First, the absorbance wavelengths of yeast and copper are in the same spectrum range. Thud, any contaminations of yeast in the supernatant could lead to alteration and artefact values in the OD measurements, resulting in data with a higher concentration than reality. Second, if any pieces of yeast bound to copper ions would end up in the supernatant, these ions would also be detected by the spectrophotometer, also leading to values with a higher concentration than the one that would have been actually removed from our yeast. Once the centrifugation step was finished, the pellet, mainly characterized by yeast cells, and the supernatant, mainly characterized by media and copper sulphate, are isolated from each other and collected for different chemical downstream processes.
    p <b>Copper concentration measurement</b> (see also <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-cupper">Cuprizone Solution Preparation and Copper Concentration Measurement protocol</a>) In this assay, the aforementioned supernatant is mixed with cuprizone and brought to a slightly basic (pH ~ 8) condition. Cuprizone [oxalic acid bis(cyclohexylidene hydrazide)] is a selective and sensitive copper-chelating agent, typically used in spectrophotometric determination of copper(II). Indeed, this chemical compound is highly sensitive to copper and, once it interacts with a copper solution, it forms a complex that absorbs at wavelengths of 580-600 nm. The absorbance at 580-600 nm of the solution is therefore proportional to the amount of copper. However, according to Messori et al., the complex with Cu(II) and cuprizone is unstable because of the fast decomposition of the reagent, also affecting the stability of the absorbance over time<ref doi="10.1039/B701896G" />. Therefore, given the strong instability of the CuCPZ complex, we analyzed its absorbance kinetics to find a stable plateau, hence an optimal time to perform the measurements, avoiding any substantial variance in the measurements. We used a spectrophotometer UV-1600PC (#634-6001) with a filter allowing the measurement of the absorbance at 600 nm for that purpose.
    p All measurements were performed with three biological replicates and three technical replicates.
    p The concentration of copper in the media was set at 4 mg/l for all copper absorption assay. We tested different conditions to identify the cause of bad copper absorption with our engineered yeasts (see the results below and the <a href="Results.html">Results page</a>).
