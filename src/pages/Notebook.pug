      h3 Gene PCR
      .date 2021-07-12

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Extract and amplify our genomic CUP1 sequence from yeast DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-gene-pcr">Gene PCR</a>
    p We had 3 genomic variants that we named Y1, Y2 and Y3. The samples had differing DNA concentrations but we put the same amount (20 ng) in each PCR tube.
    p We ran a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis to check that the size of our PCRed CUP1 DNA is as expected. We prepared two sets of tubes, one destined to the gel electrophoresis and one to be cleaned up as we do not have a UV “table” in our lab.

        span The DNA has been amplified through PCR. On the right is the low range ladder, the three lanes correspond to the three genomic variants amplified. All our amplified CUP1s have a size of around 200 base pairs (bp) which matches the theoretical size of  CUP1: 183 bp.<ref title="Copper metallothionein 1-1 (P0CX80)" authors="UniProt" url="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0CX80" />

    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> We successfully amplified CUP1 yeast using PCR. We can move on and do a PCR clean up on our samples to purify the DNA.

      h3 PCR clean-up
      .date 2021-07-12

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Purify DNA fragments directly from PCR. PCR products are commonly purified to remove excess nucleotides and primers.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-pcr-cleanup">PCR clean-up</a>
    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> We assume that the clean-up was correct, we keep our samples on the side for the following Gibson assembly with our to be digested backbone.

      h3 Plasmid digestion
      .date 2021-07-13

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Digest the plasmid with restriction enzymes to linearize it for the following Gibson assembly.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-plasmid-digestion">Plasmid digestion</a>
    p <strong>Results</strong> To verify our digestion worked properly, we ran a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis of our plasmid digested with different combinations of our restriction enzymes: BamHI alone, NheI alone, BamHI and NheI and none.

        span Labeled agarose gel of the digested vector backbone.
        span Lane 1: GeneRuler 1kb DNA Ladder. Lane 2: Plasmid digested with BamHI HF. Lane 3: Plasmid digested with NheI HF. Lane 4: Plasmid digested with both BamHI HF and NheI HF. Lane 5: Undigested plasmid. The bands in lane 2, 3 and 4 are slightly bigger than 6000 bp while the band in lane 5 is above the 10’000 band of the ladder.

    p The size of our plasmid, pCTcon2V5<ref doi="10.1038/nprot.2006.94" />, is 6468 bp. We should observe bands of this size when cutting the plasmid with either BamHI or NheI.
    p Linear DNA encounters less friction while running through the gel than circular DNA. Thus, on our gel, we expect to see the plasmid cut with either BamHI or NheI run faster than the undigested plasmid, as the plasmid would have been linearized.
    p The size of the insert between BamHI and NheI is 189 bp while the size of the plasmid without the insert is 6279 bp. In lane 4 where our plasmid was cut with both restriction enzymes, we thus expect a band near 6000 bp. Since the size difference is so small with the plasmid that was cut with only one restriction enzyme, we do not expect a difference on the gel. Furthermore, the insert band of 189 bp is too small to be seen on this gel thus we do not expect to see it.

    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> We were able to digest the pCTcon2V5 plasmid with BamHI and NheI and it worked properly. Thus we could continue with the next experiment.

      .date 2021-07-13

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Gibson Assembly will allow to anneal our CUP1 gene to the now linearized vector backbone. The recomposed gene-containing plasmid will be ready to be transformed into bacteria.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-gibson-assembly">Gibson assembly</a>
    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> We moved on to bacteria transformation and this would confirm that the Gibson Assembly worked well.

      h3 Bacteria transformation and plating
      .date 2021-07-14

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Transform bacteria with the new plasmid. Once the transformation is done, we can plate them on Ampicillin plates; these plates allow for positive selection of bacteria which will have taken up our plasmid as they have an encoded ampicillin resistance.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-bacteria-transformation">Protocol bacteria transformation and plating</a>
    p Plates were put in the inoculator at 30°C overnight. The next morning, we observed some colonies on our plates.

    p The colonies observed have the AmpR gene, that gives resistance to the bacteria against Ampicillin.
    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> Our bacteria had successfully taken up the plasmid containing the ampicillin resistance gene. Moreover, as we had asserted that the digestion was successful and as we know that bacteria can only function properly with circular DNA we could conclude that our Gibson Assembly was successful. The newly assembled plasmid was taken up by our bacteria.

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Pick 1 colony per plate that has survived Ampicillin treatment and grow it in liquid medium in order to amplify our plasmid DNA.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> Under the flame, with a sterile pipette, scoop up a colony and release the pipette tip into a 5ml tube. Add 4ml of sterile LB medium and place it in the shaker at 30°C.
    p <strong>Results</strong> We had bacterial clones to pick that contain our plasmid. We picked them and let them grow in liquid media overnight.

      h3 Sequencing
      .date 2021-07-16

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Compare our now amplified plasmid with the theoretical sequence to observe potential mutations that may have occurred during amplification in bacteria.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> Send samples to a DNA sequencing company (Mycrosynth in our case).
    p We sent 2 clones for each transformant variant : YXCX where X stands for the number of the variant and clone respectively.
    p <strong>Results</strong>  Y2C1 has a mutation (G to C) in both forward and reverse strands. We thus choose to ignore this one. It also seems like the forward primer of Y2C2 did not anneal, therefore we do not have a full strand. To avoid errors, we decide to only keep Y1 and Y3 variants.
    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> We decided to proceed with only Y1 and Y3 genomic variants and had two clones for each of them.

      h3 Yeast growth curve
      .date 2021-07-19

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Establish a yeast growth curve. This will give us information on the different stages of our yeast’s growth. Yeast cells are competent for transformation at a measured OD600 of 0.8 to 1.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> In a 15ml falcon tube, incubate 12μl of wildtype yeast in 4ml of YPD in a shaker at 30°C and 220 rpm.  Measure the absorbance at 600 nm (OD600) every hour using a spectrophotometer. A calibration curve may be needed before the actual measurements.
    p We made 3 technical replicates each time. Ideally, one would do 2 biological replicates, but limited by the space on the shaker we could only do one.

      .date 2021-07-20

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Transform the yeast with our pCTcon2-CUP1-V5 plasmid and plate our transformants on a selective medium.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-yeast-transformation">Yeast transformation</a>
    p We prepared 3 samples: a negative control (no plasmid), a positive control (our plasmid backbone without the CUP1 insert) and the plasmid containing the CUP1 gene.
    p Our yeast strain, EBY100, is incapable of metabolizing tryptophan, thus when plated onto no containing tryptophan medium plates, they cannot grow. Our plasmid backbone encodes a Trp+ gene allowing the yeast to grow without tryptophan in its medium, allowing for positive selection of our yeast transformants.
    p We picked clones from each plate. Each time a new clone is picked, it is amplified in liquid SDCAA medium. In total we picked 6 clones from the yeast transformed with the recombinant plasmid : A, B, C, D, E and F.

      h3 Western blot 1
      .date 2021-07-30

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Verify the expression of our protein of interest in yeast.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-western-blot">Western blot</a>
    p We used two mouse anti-V5 and anti-Tubulin as primary antibodies and a goat anti-mouse as a secondary.
    p The first Western blot was performed on clone A and B and had for negative controls, the wild type yeast as well as the yeast transformed with the plasmid backbone cultured in SDCAA (without galactose). For positive controls, the yeast transformed with the plasmid backbone cultured in SGCAA (with galactose) as well as a fly tubulin were runned onto the gel. The V5 tag is part of the membrane display system which itself is under the Gal promoter. Thus expression (and detection) should only occur in the presence of galactose.

        span Analysis of western blot 1.

    p We loaded the following samples onto our gel: pCTcon2-V5 in SDCAA, pCTcon2-V5 in SGCAA, EBY100 (WT) in YPD, and two pCTcon2-CUP1-V5 clones (A and B) in SGCAA and SDCAA each. We obtained a band of ~50kDa in the WT and plasmids with and without galactose, showing the presence of ⍺-tubulin in our samples. We also have a band of ~20 kDa in plasmid + galactose showing that our Aga2-V5 protein was expressed (figure 7a). Figure 7b is showing the fly control expressing tubulin as well as Relish-V5, a protein harboring the V5 tag. Figure 7c shows the ratio of V5 signal versus tubulin.
    p However we didn’t obtain any signal, neither for the tubulin nor the protein of interest in the clone A and B lines (figure 12).

    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> The clones were probably picked prematurely, and thus didn’t show anything on the gel. That’s why a second Western Blot was performed in order to check protein expression in our 4 other clones that were picked later: C, D, E and F.

      h3 Immunostaining 1
      .date 2021-08-09

    p <strong>Aim</strong> Check the expression of our CUP1 protein on the surface of our yeast transformants, clone C, D, E and F.
    p <strong>Protocol</strong> <a href="Protocols.html#protocol-immunofluorescence">Indirect immunofluorescence labeling</a>
    p We used a mouse anti-V5 primary antibody and a goat anti-mouse coupled with a green fluorophore as a secondary antibody.
    p The results were observed under a confocal microscope. For each clone, two samples were analyzed, one where the cells’ membrane were permeabilized in order to see if the protein was expressed intracellularly and one where the cells’ membrane were not permeabilized.

        span Picture of ampicillin plate D
        span Negative control: wild-type <em>E. coli</em>. No colony observed.

    p All 4 clones showed expression of CUP1 on their surface. We assumed the expression is at the surface because: first, the antibody does not enter the cell, second, we can see a darker circle around the cell on figure 8j (higher magnification) representing the membrane and third, we did some controls with membrane permeabilized samples (figure 8g). The membrane permalized samples show little signal that corresponds to the signal in negative controls WT (figure 8f), backbone without antibody 1 (figure 8h) and backbone without antibody 2 (figure 8i), which we can assume is noise or unspecific binding of antibodies.
    p Unfortunately, not all cells were positive in one sample, which means that either our subsets of cells were not monoclonal and that not all the cells had the plasmid or that they all had the plasmid but weren't all expressing it.
    p <strong>Conclusion</strong> In order to see if the expression level differences were due to polyclonality of the yeast population we streaked the cells on a plate and picked a single colony in order to perform an immunostaining on a monoclonal population of cells. This resulted in no different results than before, we still had an heterogeneous population with cells displaying signal and cells with no signal. We concluded that the induction process was not 100% efficient and this was supported by the results of the paper from Chao et al.<ref doi="10.1038/nprot.2006.94" />
